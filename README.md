# Corle - Modern Metal Guessing Game

This is the source code for a *Modern Metal Guessing Game* called corle. The website is built with **React as the frontend and Firebase as the database**. The database contains every song and each 30 second clip for every song. The python script found in the `/scripts` folder downloads the first 30 seconds of every song and puts it into Firebase.

The code found in the `/client` folder contains the code for the frontend in *ReactJS*.

The deployed site can be found at https://corle.vercel.app/.
